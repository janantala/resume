Hello there!

I am an **Innovation Engineer** based in [Bratislava, Slovakia](https://www.google.com/maps/search/Bratislava,+Slovakia). I love making things and helping other people make things. I like **Open Source** and have contributed pieces to a number of [projects](https://github.com/angular-adaptive).

I am passionate about **JavaScript and Mobile Technologies**. I aim to craft apps that adapt beautifully on every device, from smartphones and wearable devices to cars and TVs.

I also like to talk and tweet about it. Check out my [talk slides](http://www.janantala.com/slides), [writings](http://janantala.github.io/beyond-adaptive-web-design/) and feel free to [drop me a line](mailto:hello@janantala.com).
